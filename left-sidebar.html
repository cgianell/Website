											<p>
											I was born in <a target="_blank" href="http://cs-people.bu.edu/cgianell/cs103/lab2/part2/image.html">La Rioja</a>, Argentina 
											on June 23rd, 1998. I had a pretty privileged childhood, by age 14 I had already visited Barcelona, Madrid, Paris, Rome and Miami. 
											Not only did I learn a lot about the different cultures but also their locations and people. Perhaps it was due to the fact that we 
											would go on these vacations during me and my sister’s summer breaks which I unconsciously related to the warm weather, maybe it was 
											even the fact that I was privileged enough to have air conditioning and a pool, regardless, I came to love the hot weather.
											School in Argentina (and probably everywhere else) is quite different from that of the United States. Instead of going from one class to another, every year students from a respective 
											level (freshmen, juniors, seniors, etc.) would be assigned one classroom which they were to remain in for that entire year. This gave that classroom a much more “homey” feeling for 
											students as that was “their” room, compared to the U.S where teachers are the ones who are given a classroom and students are just passing by.
											Also, while in Argentina your grade level determines many factors such as level of knowledge, group (A or B), room, etc. The U.S grade level mostly only determines how close to 
											graduation students are. Thus different grade students could interact with each other since classes were not restricted to specific levels which meant having to interact with new students 
											for almost every class. In contrast, in Argentina you are stuck with essentially the same students from grade 4 to 12, in the U.S this would change every semester. While many people in the U.S 
											would probably dislike the idea of being with the same people every year, we get to know our classmates as our “second family” and as such we become really close, for better or for worse. 
											Obviously, it is impossible to like every person in a 20~30 person group. However, these differences and disagreements would prove essential in developing an understanding of people and 
											society overall. I would summarize the school experience in Argentina as “learning to understand your friends” whereas in the U.S is more about “learning to make new friends”.
